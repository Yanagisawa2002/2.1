# ExecPlans

## What is an ExecPlan
An ExecPlan is a living design+implementation checklist that is self-contained:
- scope, assumptions, non-goals
- exact files to touch
- commands to run
- milestones with acceptance criteria
- a decision log (why we chose X not Y)

## Required sections
1. Problem statement (what works after this plan)
2. Data contracts (inputs/outputs and file formats)
3. Implementation plan (milestones)
4. Verification plan (tests + smoke runs)
5. Risks & mitigations
6. Progress log (update as you implement)
